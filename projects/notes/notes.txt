cargo build new --bin
This makes a new cargo project. --bin specifies it's a binary, not a library.

cargo build
This makes the app.
Adding --release builds it with optimizations. 

cargo check
This checks if your project will compile without creating the executable. It's faster than build.

cargo run
This will compile and run your project in one step. Use it for testing.
